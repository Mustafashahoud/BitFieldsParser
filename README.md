A simple Android App implements a Serializable Interface.

Serialization is the process of converting a object into a stream.‎

Deserialization is the process of reconstructing an object that has been ‎serialized before.

Serialize() method converts a data Structure into Byte Array that can be sent ‎sequentially over a ‎connection ‎

And then the receiver will DEserialize it by deserialize() and reconstruct the object.
