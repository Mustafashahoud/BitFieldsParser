A simple Android App implements a Serializable Interface
Serialization is the process of converting a object into a stream ‎
Deserialization is the process of reconstructing an object that has been ‎serialized before
Serialize method converts a data Structure into Byte Array that can be sent ‎sequentially over a ‎connection ‎
And then the receiver will DE serialize it and reconstruct the object ‎
This is a useful way to use the serializable Interface but what we can do more is ‎to put the ‎
Attributes of an object into a file and then get them back "but that object must ‎implement the serializable ‎Interface
